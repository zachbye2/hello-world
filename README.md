# hello-world
Hey Future Zach.

You will probably be the only one who reads this. Maybe not. Who really knows... Anyways... I wanted to say to you that you did a good job in the past by deciding to learn how to code on Udacity. If you ever want to make Voveogo come to life and its Sumo VoteDirect system that programming is the valuable tool you will need to learn to bolster your vision.

Keep working hard and I hope you have not lost focus yet with your goals to code a Direct Democracy.

Take it easy my friend.

Learning to love.
Zach
